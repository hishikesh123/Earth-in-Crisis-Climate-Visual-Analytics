## Global Temperature Trends
Analysis of global surface temperature anomalies reveals a clear and persistent warming trend over time. Temperature increases are particularly pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere and polar regions, highlighting the uneven spatial distribution of climate change impacts.

These patterns support existing scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic climate change and its acceleration in recent decades.

## Natural Disaster Frequency and Impact
Since 2000, the frequency and severity of natural disasters have increased globally. The analysis shows:

- A steady rise in disaster occurrences across most regions
- Disproportionate impacts on certain geographic areas
- Significant variation in disaster type prevalence by region

Floods and storms account for the highest number of recorded events, while earthquakes and heatwaves contribute disproportionately to fatalities.

## Human and Economic Consequences
The dashboard analysis demonstrates that:

- High-fatality disasters are not always the most frequent
- Economic damage is heavily concentrated in developed regions
- Developing regions often experience higher human impact relative to economic loss

This disparity underscores global inequality in disaster preparedness and recovery capacity.

## Temporal Patterns
Animated visualisations reveal cyclical and long-term trends:

- Increasing disaster-related damage over time
- Growing populations affected per event
- Periods of compounding disasters within short time frames

These trends suggest escalating strain on infrastructure, healthcare systems, and emergency response mechanisms.

## Value of Interactivity
Interactive exploration significantly enhances insight generation. Users can:

- Compare disaster impacts across years and regions
- Identify outlier events with extreme consequences
- Observe relationships between disaster type and impact dimensions

This reinforces the importance of interactive dashboards in modern data storytelling and decision support.
