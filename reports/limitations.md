# Limitations

## Data Quality and Completeness
Despite using reputable data sources, several limitations remain:

- Missing or underreported disaster records in certain regions
- Inconsistent economic damage estimates across countries
- Variability in historical reporting standards

These factors may lead to underestimation or bias in some analyses.

---

## Temporal and Spatial Resolution
Climate datasets rely on interpolation in regions with sparse measurements, particularly in earlier periods and polar areas. While modern datasets reduce these gaps, uncertainty remains in historical reconstructions.

Disaster data is aggregated at national or regional levels, limiting fine-grained local analysis.

---

## Methodological Constraints
Outlier handling and imputation methods, while necessary, introduce assumptions that may influence results. Alternative statistical treatments could yield different interpretations.

Additionally, correlations observed in visualisations do not imply causation and should be interpreted cautiously.

---

## Scope Limitations
This project focuses on descriptive and exploratory analysis rather than predictive modelling. It does not explicitly model causal relationships between climate change and disaster frequency.

---

## Dashboard Performance
Interactive dashboards are constrained by browser performance and hosting limitations. Very large datasets or complex animations may impact responsiveness for some users.

---

## Ethical Considerations
Visualisations simplify complex human and environmental suffering into aggregated metrics. Care has been taken to present data respectfully; however, quantitative summaries cannot fully capture social, cultural, or individual-level impacts.

---

## Future Improvements
Future work could incorporate:
- Predictive modelling of climate-related disasters
- Socioeconomic vulnerability indices
- Higher-resolution spatial datasets
- Real-time data integration

These extensions would strengthen analytical depth and policy relevance.
